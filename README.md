### Project Nine - 100DaysOfCode
# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a simple program (game) which takes a user input, compares it to a random generated computer input and counts the score between the user and the computer to determine who won based of the rock, paper, scissors game rules.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate library.
3. Create a variable to hold the user score and computer score.
4. Create a list and assign it to a variable. The list should hold the game input options.
5. Use the appropriate method to iterate through the program and ask for user inputs. 
6. Using lists (or appropriate functionality) and the random library (or appropriate library), assign an option as computer input.
7. Create a variable to accept user inputs.
8. Evaluate the user input against the options to ensure that correct inputs are passed.
9. Use if conditional statements to match the correct options. Where the user got it correct, add one to the user score where the user guesses right and one to the computer score when the user guesses wrong.
10. Print the total wins each after the user quits the program.
11. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* I learned the application of lists in this program. Lists and the random library combine to good effect. I reckon with extremely large lists, it can be unbearable.
* I have gain better understanding to loops and how they can be applied in projects. The 'while True' loop is a legend.
* I have learnt the application of the .lower() function in development.
